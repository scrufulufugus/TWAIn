## About <a name="about"></a>

TWAIn is a simple machine learning based game that I created to learn the fundamentals of [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org). Parts of the rendering code are adapted from [Gh0stenstein](https://github.com/jtmfam/Gh0stenstein), an implementation of the Wolfenstein 3D engine in [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org).

## Getting Started <a name="getstarted"></a>

TWAIn was originally built for Python 3.6, Tensorflow r1.9, Pygame 1.9.4, and Numpy 1.14.

### Installing Dependencies <a name="installing"></a>

``` sh
$ pip install tensorflow numpy pygame
```
